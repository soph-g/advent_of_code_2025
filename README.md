# 🎄☃️ 🎁 Advent of Code 2025 🎁☃️🎄

4th time attempting advent of code.
1st time in JS.

Doing this for fun, and to push my algorithms knowledge a little.

## Instructions

I'm using Node to run the code, so once the file is ready to run:

```
node lib/day[XX]
```
e.g.
```
node lib/day01
```

Answer outputs should be `console.log`-ed.

I have a `utils` file that includes some code to read the input file.
Recommend creating a test file for each day to run the code on smaller inputs during build.
